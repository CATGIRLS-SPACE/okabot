# style guide (sorta)! :3

- okabot is not serious, there should be no harsh language that isn't implemented jokingly.
- okabot's signature color is 0x9d60cc (hex #9d60cc). all embeds or opportunities to use this color by default should use it.
- when implementing a currency display, the text must be sent as `:okash: OKA**<value>**`.
- when an XP gain is not part of a sentence, it must be displayed at the end of a message and bolded, such as `**(+15XP)**`

# tips
you can make google cloud ignore real-time translated text default emojis by changing, e.g. `:package:`, into `<:package:0>`
